## Run Application

```bash
./gradlew :api-gateway-service:clean :api-gateway-service:build :api-gateway-service:bootRun
```

This will expose the REST endpoints available and the actuator: 
- health: `/actuator/health`
- gateway routes: `/actuator/gateway/routes` 
- gateway requests: `/actuator/metrics/spring.cloud.gateway.requests`
- prometheus: `/actuator/prometheus`

## Test Application

```bash
./gradlew :api-gateway-service:test
```

## Technological Stack

* Oracle JDK 21 with preview features
* Spring Boot v3 (Spring Framework v6)
  * Spring Actuator (Prometheus)
* Spring Cloud Gateway
  * Circuit Breaker (resilience4j)
